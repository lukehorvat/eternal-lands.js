# el-packets [![npm version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/el-packets.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/el-packets) [![build status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/lukehorvat/el-packets/Build?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/lukehorvat/el-packets/actions/workflows/build.yml)

An implementation of the [Eternal Lands](http://www.eternal-lands.com) packet layer... in TypeScript/JavaScript!

Provides several abstractions for managing the "low-level" (sending and receiving of packets) so that you can focus on building the "high-level" (trade bots, guard bots, AI-controlled ants, etc).

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```sh
$ npm install el-packets
```

## Usage

TODO.
